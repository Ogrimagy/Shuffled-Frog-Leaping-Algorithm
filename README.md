# Shuffled Frog Leaping Algorithm for task scheduling in Cloud Computing
 
Welcome!

This Java algorithm was designed with education in mind, both for learning and teaching purposes. Before exploring the code, it is essential to understand how this algorithm operates. In short, it uses heuristics to find a solution to a problem by gradually improving upon an initial solution, rather than finding the optimal solution right away.

The algorithm begins by generating an initial solution, which is then modified and improved upon through the use of various heuristics. These heuristics may include things like swapping elements within the solution, adding or removing elements, or simply adjusting the values of certain elements. The goal is to find a solution that is as close to optimal as possible, given the limitations of the heuristics being used.

One of the key features of this algorithm is its ability to adapt to changing conditions. As the problem or the constraints of the solution change, the algorithm can be modified to continue finding effective solutions.

I hope this gives you a good understanding of how the methaheurisic algorithm works. Additional information about the algorithm's operation can be found in the "SFLA_CONCEPT.pdf" file located within the project.

Now, take a look at the code to see how it is implemented in Java!

The steps to run the code are as follows:
1) Install netbeans and open the project.
2) Open the SFLA package and run the main class.

Have fun!
