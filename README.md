# Shuffled Frog Leaping Algorithm for task scheduling in Cloud Computing
 
Hey there, Welcome!

This algorithm is implemented in Java and intended for educational and learning purposes.

Before diving into the code, it is important to understand how this algorithm operates. Essentially, this algorithm is designed to find a solution to a problem through the use of heuristics. It works by iteratively improving upon a solution, rather than finding the optimal solution outright.

The algorithm begins by generating an initial solution, which is then modified and improved upon through the use of various heuristics. These heuristics may include things like swapping elements within the solution, adding or removing elements, or simply adjusting the values of certain elements. The goal is to find a solution that is as close to optimal as possible, given the limitations of the heuristics being used.

One of the key features of this algorithm is its ability to adapt to changing conditions. As the problem or the constraints of the solution change, the algorithm can be modified to continue finding effective solutions.

I hope this gives you a good understanding of how the methaheurisic algorithm works. Now, take a look at the code to see how it is implemented in Java!

The steps to run the code are as follows:
1) Install netbeans and open the project.
2) Open the SFLA package and run the main class.
