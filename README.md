# Shuffled Frog Leaping Algorithm (SFLA) for Task Scheduling in Cloud Computing

## üìù Overview

This project demonstrates the **Shuffled Frog Leaping Algorithm (SFLA)**, a metaheuristic algorithm designed for solving task scheduling problems in cloud computing environments. SFLA uses a population-based approach inspired by the behavior of frogs searching for optimal solutions to improve performance and resource utilization in cloud systems.

The goal of this algorithm is not to find a perfect solution immediately but to **iteratively improve** an initial solution using **heuristics**. These heuristics help refine the solution by applying techniques like element swapping, value adjustments, and reordering to approach an optimal solution.

The SFLA adapts to dynamic conditions, making it well-suited for cloud computing, where task demands and resources fluctuate. As conditions or constraints evolve, the algorithm can adjust and continue providing effective scheduling solutions.

For a deeper understanding of the algorithm, refer to the **[SFLA_CONCEPT.pdf](./SFLA_CONCEPT.pdf)** file included in the project, which explains the underlying methodology and theory.

## üîß How SFLA Works

- Initial Solution: The algorithm begins by creating an initial schedule for tasks.
- Heuristic Improvement: Through multiple iterations, the algorithm refines the schedule using heuristics like task swapping, priority adjustments, and reordering.
- Convergence: The solution gradually improves, approaching an optimal or near-optimal schedule, adapting to changes in resource availability and constraints.
